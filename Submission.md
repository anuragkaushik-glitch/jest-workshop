## Tests Written

List each test you wrote and briefly explain **what bug or regression it prevents**.

### 1.No Coupon Case:
**It checks the case when a user has not used any coupon and returns the final subtotal without coupon**  

---

### 2. Save 10 Coupon used correctly and max value:
**It makes sure that discount is not more that 100(can be 100) and also checks if it is being applied properly**  

---

### 3. Flat 50 coupon check and max value:
**It makes sure that the discount is 50 with the Flat 50 coupon and also if it works properly**

## Reflection (1–2 lines)
What is **one thing** you understood better about testing or CI after this workshop?

The most important thing I learned is how much time it can save for me like checking every feature again and again gets very boring over time but now it will help me a lot
